This repository is another password manager. Just download the .zip file, unzip it, and run install! After that, the password-manager can be run by using the python3 command to run main.py


**NOTE:** You may need to make install runable first before running it. If you run install, and you get a Permission denined error, then you need to make it runable. Do so by running the following command:

chmod +x install
